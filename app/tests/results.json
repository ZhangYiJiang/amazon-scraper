(Feel free to skip early chapters that cover elementary topics like alerts, variables, and strings).  Step-by-step, you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript as well as some advanced concepts including constructors and prototypes.</p><p>The book is extremely user-friendly. It assumes no programming experience. Chapters cover only as much as the average learner can absorb in ten minutes, so you're never asked to eat an elephant. Explanations are in plain, nontechnical English that people of all backgrounds can readily understand.  With ample coding examples and illustrations.</p><p>The most important part: free, online, interactive exercises paired with each chapter. Cognitive research shows that retention increases 400 percent when learners are challenged to retrieve the information they just read. You'll spend two to three times as long practicing as reading. When you code incorrectly, you'll get as many do-overs as you need, until you know it cold.</p><p>Testing showed that books and courses load up the reader with <em>far</em> too much information at a time. So I divide up the information into little chunks that won't overwhelm you.</p><p>A book on coding doesn't have to be written in impenetrable legalese. It can actually be human-readable. My book is.</p><p>People often learn best through examples, so I provide plenty of them.</p><p>Most important, before you have a chance to forget what you've read in the book, I ask you to fire up your desktop or laptop (not your mobile device) and head over to my website, where you run a set of interactive exercises, practicing everything you've learned\u2014until you're sure you've mastered it.</p><p>Readers tell me they often start the exercises thinking they've learned the latest lesson, and quickly find out they're still a little shaky on it. The automated exercise manager protects you against this common learner delusion. It keeps you at it until your overconfidence becomes real confidence\u2014confidence that's based on your excellent performance. There are 1,750 exercises in all. They're all interactive, with an automated answer-checker that corrects your missteps and points you in the right direction when you stumble. And they're all free.</p><p>Thousands of readers have filled out feedback forms telling me that the combination of the book and interactive exercises is involving, fun, frustration-free, addictive, confidence-building, and...well, read the reviews.</p></div>\n<em></em>\n</noscript>",

    "description": "<noscript>\n<div> <div><p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole\u2014a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p><p>Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.</p><p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p><ul><li>Syntax</li><li>Objects</li><li>Functions</li><li>Inheritance</li><li>Arrays</li><li>Regular expressions</li><li>Methods</li><li>Style</li><li>Beautiful features</li></ul><p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.</p><p>With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.</p></div></div>\n<em></em>\n</noscript>",

    "description": "<noscript>\n<div> <div><p>JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps to the newest browser-based games. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.</p><p><i>Eloquent JavaScript, 2nd Edition</i> dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. Author Marijn Haverbeke immerses you in example code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn:</p><ul><li>The essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data</li><li>How to organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques</li><li>How to script the browser and make basic web applications</li><li>How to use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers</li><li>How to harness Node.js to build servers and utilities</li></ul>This edition is thoroughly revised and modernized to reflect the current state of JavaScript and web browsers, with brand-new material, such as a chapter on code performance in Java\u00c2\u00adScript, and expanded coverage of recursion and closures. All source code is available online in an interactive sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.<p>Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web?</p></div></div>\n<em></em>\n</noscript>",
